# microreg
"Micro" voltage regulator to be used on a mini glider plane, for the engineless category.

This voltage regulator was created so it can be assembled with the components available on the argentinian market, specially in Cordoba, where I live, it can certainly be done smaller if you use double sided boards and smaller smd components but that also increases the price and it was created to be good, cheap and reliable :-) goals that were archieved, about 5 of this units were sold and currently is not being produced anymore.
